OpenSimMutelist add-on module for Open Simulator

Requirements

A webserver with PHP 4.3 (or later) and with XMLRPC support.
NOTES: Not all webservers include XMLRPC support in their default installation.
       This module may work with 0.8.2 but it has only been tested with 0.9.

How it works

If you are looking for a detailed explanation of how the add-on mutelist system
works you should study the contents of the files which accompany this README
file. What follows is a general overview of the mutelist package to give you
an idea of how the pieces fit together in case you have any problems.

There are three main components to OpenSimMutelist which are a database table,
a DLL file, and a couple of PHP files.


Compiling the module

The easiest way to create the DLL file needed by OpenSim is to add the
OpenSimMutelist C# source file to the source tree of OpenSim so it will
be compiled at the same time that OpenSim is compiled.

Copy the OpenSimMutelist directory in to the addon-modules directory of your
OpenSim source tree. After you have done that, compile OpenSim in the usual
way (runprebuild and xbuild) to create the DLL file. When xbuild finishes,
you will have an OpenSimMutelist.Modules.dll file in the main bin directory
of your OpenSim source tree along with a matching .pdb (or .mdb) file. These
two files will be copied to the bin directory of your OpenSim instances
during the installation or update steps.


First time installation and configuration

The first installation step is the creation of a database table that will
hold the mutelist data. You can include the table in an existing database
you are already using with Open Simulator or you can create a database that
will only be used by the mutelist module.

Once you know the name of the database you will be using for the mutelist
data you can use osmutelist.sql (located in the webroot/sql directory) to
create the required table in the database. The name of the database will
be needed in a later step when you configure one of the PHP files.

Copy the PHP files (located in the webroot directory) to your webserver.
Remember to set the ownership and permissions on the files so the webserver
may access the files. Use a text editor to open databaseinfo.php and enter
the name or IP address of the database server, the name of the database,
and the user name and password required to access the database.

The next part of the installation process is to set up and configure your
OpenSim instances.

Copy the OpenSimMutelist.Module.dll file created during the compile steps
(above) to the bin directory of each of your OpenSim instances. The next
part of the installation process requires some changes to the OpenSim.ini
file in each of your OpenSim instances.

Open the OpenSim.ini in your favourite editorg. Find the [Messaging] section.
Set MuteListModule to OpenSimMutelist. Set MuteListURL to a URL that points
to the mutelist.php file on your webserver.

If you make these changes to running instances you will need to restart them
before the change to the OpenSim.ini will take effect and this module will be
used to help track mutelist changes.
